sunaku's Ruby wmiirc:

  This is a Ruby[1] and YAML[2] based configuration of the wmii[3]
  window manager.  It manipulates wmii through the Rumai[4] library,
  which comes with an interactive shell[5] for live experimentation.

  [2] http://yaml.org
  [3] http://wmii.suckless.org
  [4] http://snk.tuxfamily.org/lib/rumai/
  [5] http://snk.tuxfamily.org/lib/rumai/#Tutorial

  This configuration is also discussed in the following articles:

  * http://wmii.suckless.org/alternative_wmiirc_scripts
  * http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.wmii/1704
  * http://snk.tuxfamily.org/web/2006-07-01-wmii-3-1-configuration-in-ruby.html

Prerequisites:

  * wmii 3.6 or newer (preferably wmii-hg)
  * dmenu 4.0 or newer
  * Ruby 1.9 or newer
  * Rumai 3.2.0 or newer (gem install rumai)

Installation:

  # backup
  mv ~/.wmii ~/.wmii.backup
  mv ~/.wmii-hg ~/.wmii-hg.backup

  # install
  git clone git://github.com/sunaku/wmiirc.git ~/.wmii
  ln -s ~/.wmii ~/.wmii-hg

  # branch
  git checkout -b personal
  cp -b ~/.wmii/example.yaml ~/.wmii/config.yaml

Upgrading:

  # assuming that origin is sunaku/wmiirc
  git fetch origin
  git checkout personal
  git rebase origin/master

Running:

  * Ensure that your ~/.xinitrc supports crash recovery:

      xterm -e tail -f ~/.wmii/wmiirc.log &

      while true; do
        wmii
        xmessage 'Restart the Window Manager?' \
                 -buttons 'Yes:1,No:0' -center \
                 -default 'Yes' -timeout 30    \
        && break
      done

    This will allow you to restart wmii without losing your
    applications if it crashes or if you accidentally kill it.

  * If wmii is already running, then run ~/.wmii/wmiirc to start
    the configuration.  Otherwise, run `startx` normally and wmii
    will automatically recognize and apply this configuration.

Configuration:

  * Edit ~/.wmii/config.yaml to your liking.

    For a real-life example, see my personal config.yaml:
    http://github.com/sunaku/wmiirc/blob/personal/config.yaml

  * Run ~/.wmii/wmiirc to apply your changes.
